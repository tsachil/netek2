# BT-CTS Planning Closeout

Date: February 8, 2026

## Planning Scope Closure
Planning artifacts are now complete for the implementation lifecycle from P0 through P4:
1. Phase-by-phase implementation plan: `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. Operations response procedures: `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/OPS_RUNBOOK.md`
3. Backup and recovery procedures: `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/BACKUP_RECOVERY_RUNBOOK.md`
4. UAT scenarios and error matrix: `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/UAT_SCENARIOS.md`
5. UAT sign-off record template: `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/UAT_SIGNOFF_TEMPLATE.md`
6. Final execution queue to go-live: `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/GO_LIVE_EXECUTION_QUEUE.md`

## What "Planning Complete" Means
1. All required planning documents exist and are internally consistent.
2. Remaining delivery work is execution-focused, not planning-blocked.
3. Open decisions are explicitly listed with owners and impact.
4. Go/no-go acceptance checks are defined before release.

## Remaining Open Decisions
1. 7-year retention storage strategy (partitioning/archive destination).
2. Hosting baseline for production monitoring and backup infrastructure.
3. Pager/Slack integration endpoint ownership and escalation policy.

## Transition to Execution
From this point, work should be tracked against the queue in:
- `/Users/tsachil/Projects/myapps/netek2/GO_LIVE_EXECUTION_QUEUE.md`

No additional top-level planning documents are required unless PRD scope changes.
